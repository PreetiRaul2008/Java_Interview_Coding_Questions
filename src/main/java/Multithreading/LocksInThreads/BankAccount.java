     * - Once Thread-1 enters withdraw() and sleeps for 10 seconds,
     * Thread-2 would be forced to WAIT the entire 10 seconds,
     * even if it just wanted to check the balance.
     * <p>
     * ðŸ”¹ With ReentrantLock + tryLock():
     * - Thread-2 tries to acquire the lock.
     * - If the lock is already taken by Thread-1, it immediately fails
     * and prints a message like "could not acquire lock".
     * - This prevents Thread-2 from getting stuck waiting unnecessarily.
