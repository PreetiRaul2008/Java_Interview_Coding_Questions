 /*  Multitasking: Involves multiple processes running simultaneously.
                    Managed by the operating system.
                    Each process has its own memory space.
                    Achieved through time-sharing and context switching.

     Multithreading:Involves multiple threads within the same process.
                    Threads share the same memory space but have their own stack.
                    More lightweight and faster context switching compared to processes.

     **Key Concepts**
     - Thread: Smallest unit of a process that can execute independently.Shares memory space with other threads in the same process.
     - Process: Independent program with its own memory space.
     - Context Switching: CPU switches between processes or threads, saving and loading state. More overhead with processes than with threads.
     - Threads Share: Heap memory, file descriptors, code segments.
     - Threads Donâ€™t Share: Stack, thread-specific data, CPU registers*/
